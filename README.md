Problem Statement: Real-Time Chat with Task Board

Introduction:
Your task is to create a web application using MERN Stack that allows remote teams to have real-time conversations and manage tasks simultaneously. The platform should consist of two main features:
A real-time chat room. 
A Kanban-style task board.


Objectives:
- Users can log in and join different rooms or create new rooms for chat.
- Messages in the chat rooms should appear in real-time.
- Users can create, edit, move, and delete tasks in a shared Kanban board.
- All updates on the Kanban board should be visible in real-time to all users in the same room.
- The application must be deployed and should be accessible via the internet.
